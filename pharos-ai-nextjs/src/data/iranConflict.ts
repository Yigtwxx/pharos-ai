  summary: `On February 28, 2026, the United States and Israel launched a coordinated joint strike on Iran — the most ambitious Western military operation against the Islamic Republic since its founding. Codenamed Operation Epic Fury by the Pentagon and Operation Roaring Lion by the IDF, the campaign targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, ballistic missile infrastructure, air defense networks, and regime leadership. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei was killed when his compound in Tehran was struck. Multiple IRGC commanders and ministers were simultaneously assassinated. Iran responded with waves of ballistic missiles against Israel and U.S. military bases across the Gulf. The Strait of Hormuz remains closed. Operations are ongoing as of March 1, 2026.`,
