Multiple large explosions reported across the capital. Iranian air defenses were simultaneously suppressed by Tomahawk cruise missile volleys from the USS Gerald R. Ford CSG.',
    fullContent: `At 04:32 UTC on February 28, 2026, US and Israeli forces launched the opening strikes of a coordinated campaign against Iran.

US Air Force B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, operating from Diego Garcia, delivered the first munitions against leadership compounds in Tehran. Simultaneously, IDF F-35I Adir jets struck Khamenei's residential compound in Saadatabad, northwest Tehran. Multiple secondary explosions were observed by satellite.

US Navy Tomahawk cruise missiles from the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group targeted Iranian S-300 and SA-65 air defense batteries in western Iran to suppress retaliatory capability. Pentagon officials confirmed the operation had been in planning for several months.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a public statement within minutes of the strikes commencing: "The IDF is striking the head of the snake." Trump posted a video to Truth Social stating that the US had launched operations alongside Israel to destroy Iran's nuclear program and missile capability.

Iranian state television was disrupted but resumed broadcast within 30 minutes. Initial reports from Tehran residents described a sequence of heavy explosions followed by sustained anti-aircraft fire visible across the city.`,

    fullContent: `At approximately 05:50 UTC, USAF B-2 Spirit bombers delivered 14 GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) — the world's most powerful conventional bunker-buster bomb — against the deeply buried nuclear enrichment facilities at Fordow and Natanz.

Fordow, buried 80–100m beneath a mountain near Qom, had been assessed as the most hardened nuclear facility in Iran. The facility housed approximately 1,000 IR-1 centrifuges. Multiple MOPs were required to penetrate to the facility level. Initial BDA (bomb damage assessment) via satellite indicates catastrophic structural damage.

Natanz, the primary uranium enrichment site, was struck with additional GBU-57s and conventional JDAMs. The above-ground pilot fuel enrichment plant was simultaneously targeted by Israeli F-15I aircraft.

Foundation for Defense of Democracies confirmed via FDD Action: "This is the largest B-2 operational strike in US history." The strike employed 14 of the roughly 20 MOPs believed to be in the US arsenal.

IAEA Director General confirmed loss of safeguards sensor contact with both Fordow and Natanz approximately 40 minutes after the strikes. Russia immediately called for an emergency IAEA Board of Governors session.

Former US National Security Advisor John Bolton: "This is exactly what should have been done 20 years ago."`,

    fullContent: `At 12:00 UTC, the IRGC formally announced the closure of the Strait of Hormuz to all commercial and military traffic, executing a long-stated deterrence threat.

The Strait, at its narrowest just 21 nautical miles wide between Iran and Oman, is the world's most critical energy chokepoint. More than 14 million barrels per day — approximately one-third of global seaborne crude exports — transit the Strait annually, along with significant volumes of LNG.

Shipping reports confirmed over 200 vessels, including oil tankers, LNG carriers, and container ships, dropped anchor in the waters approaching the Strait. The IRGC deployed fast-attack craft and threatened to fire upon any vessel attempting transit.

Reuters confirmed: "At least three tankers in the Gulf have been damaged since the U.S. and Israel began trading strikes with Iran. It is unclear whether the damage was done deliberately or accidentally."

Maersk statement: "We have paused Trans-Suez sailings through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait for the moment. Some sailings will be rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope. All vessel crossings in the Strait of Hormuz are also suspended."

Oil futures spiked approximately 35% in after-hours trading. Brent crude hit $143/barrel. US gasoline futures jumped significantly. Economists warned of a severe supply shock if the closure persists beyond 1–2 weeks.

This follows the largest protest movement in Iran since the Islamic Revolution (2025–2026), during which Iran killed thousands of civilian protesters.

    fullContent: `Following IRNA's confirmation of Supreme Leader Khamenei's death, large crowds of Iranians took to the streets of Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, and other cities in scenes of celebration.

The New York Times reported: "Large crowds of Iranians poured into the streets of Tehran and other cities across Iran overnight, celebrating the news that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had been killed during a day of coordinated U.S. and Israeli attacks."

This development has significant intelligence implications. The 2025–2026 Iranian protests — described as the largest since the Islamic Revolution — were met with a massacre of thousands of civilians by regime security forces in January 2026. Trump had stated "help is on the way" in response to the crackdown.

The celebratory response suggests a significant portion of the Iranian population views the regime's collapse as positive. This undermines the regime's claim to represent the Iranian people and complicates the IRGC's ability to mobilize domestic support for continued retaliation.

Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), speaking on CNN, stated: "I saw no intelligence that Iran was on the verge of launching any kind of preemptive strike against the United States of America. None." This directly contradicted the Trump administration's stated justification for the operation.

Maersk confirmed it was pausing all Trans-Suez sailings and rerouting available vessels via the Cape of Good Hope. Other major carriers including CMA CGM and MSC were assessing their routes.

The Bab el-Mandeb closure, combined with the Strait of Hormuz closure, has effectively bottled up oil and gas exports from the Persian Gulf entirely. Lloyd's of London declared a "war risk" zone covering the entire Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and Arabian Sea — triggering insurance rate spikes.

Houthi actions had previously disrupted approximately 15% of global trade during 2024–2025. The resumption of attacks following a period of relative calm significantly widens the conflict's economic impact.

PM Netanyahu statement: "Israeli strikes have also killed several leaders involved in the Iranian nuclear programme and that strikes against sites linked to the programme would continue in the coming days."

CSIS analysis: "Initial reports suggest targets have included administrative hubs and dual-use scientific research facilities. There are unconfirmed reports that the United States has struck the Iran Atomic Energy Agency headquarters in Tehran and the explosive research testing facility at Parchin, as well as conducted further strikes at the Isfahan nuclear complex."`,

    location:  'Washington D.C. / Mar-a-Lago',
    summary:   'President Trump told CNBC the operation is "moving along very well — ahead of schedule." He described it as "a very noble mission for the world." However, Senate Intelligence Committee ranking member Mark Warner stated he had seen "no intelligence" suggesting Iran was planning a preemptive strike — directly contradicting the administration\'s legal justification. Congressional Democrats demanded briefings.',
    fullContent: `President Trump conducted a phone interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen from Mar-a-Lago on the morning of March 1, 2026:

"We're moving along very well, very well — ahead of schedule. It's a very violent regime, one of the most violent regimes in history. We're doing our job not just for us but for the world. And everything is ahead of schedule."

Trump described a potential off-ramp: "Things are evolving in a very positive way right now, a very positive way." He did not specify terms for a ceasefire.

However, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and cleared for highly classified intelligence, contradicted the administration's justification:

"I saw no intelligence that Iran was on the verge of launching any kind of preemptive strike against the United States of America. None." Warner was responding to a senior Trump official's claim that "we had analysis that basically told us, if we sat back and waited to get hit first, the amount of casualties and damage would be substantially higher."

Republican counterpart Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) defended the strikes: "President Trump is right that it is absolutely vital and necessary now to address that threat before it fully materializes in the near future."

This political divide has significant implications for the operation's legal standing under the War Powers Resolution and for the bipartisan support required for sustained funding.`,
